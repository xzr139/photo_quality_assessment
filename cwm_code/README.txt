This is code that implements the cluster-weighted model regression framework, described in "The Nature of Mathematical Modeling" by Neil Gershenfeld (1999) and used in "Estimating perception of scene layout properties from global image features" by Ross and Oliva (Journal of Vision, 2010).

This code was developed and is made available solely for educational, academic, and research purposes.

Cluster-weighted models can be trained using emFitCWM and then used with cwmEstimate to perform regression on new examples. See the comments at the top of each file for more details.
